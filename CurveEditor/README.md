# CurveEditor Manual
Author: Abudureheman Adila  

### Description of the Program
This is a simply Bezier and B-Spline curve editor where the user will be able to add, insert, delete and modify the points and drawing relevant curves. There are two different algorithim are developed inside this and user will be able to select different modes by selected the options by on the menu. User will be able to change parameters and for both two different curve algorithms.

### Operating System Check
If you are using MAC OS, please go to the Makefile to uncomment the OpenGL library for MAC (Line 6). And be sure to comment out the OpenGL for Linux/CSIF

### Steps to use my Two Dimentional Curve Editor Program  
Step 1: make  
Step 2: ./main.x  
Step 3: Select n value   
Step 4: Click on the screen to see results   
You can slide the n value to see the differences  
Space Bar: Switch between different polygons    
   

##### if select Bezier Curve:  
Select n value first and start adding line segments   
Add, delete, modify the points as needed      


##### if select B-Spline Curve:  
Select Resolution values and K value to start add line segments   
Add, delete, modify the points as needed    

##### Special Instructions:  
Add mode is where you can add points to the curve   
Delete mode is where you can delete points from current working curve   
Modify is making changes to current working curve points   
"New Curve" button is to add a new polygon  
"Delete" button is to delete the selected polygon  
"Clear All" is to delete everything and restart with fresh UI    


## Thank you for using my program, have a great day!
